## **Design**

### Architecture

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureDiagram.puml" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of classes [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2425S2-CS2103-F15-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/tassist/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2425S2-CS2103-F15-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/tassist/MainApp.java)) is in charge of the app launch and shut down.
* At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `del -i 1`.

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.puml" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<puml src="diagrams/ComponentManagers.puml" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2425S2-CS2103-F15-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/tassist/ui/Ui.java)

<puml src="diagrams/UiClassDiagram.puml" alt="Structure of the UI Component"/>

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2425S2-CS2103-F15-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/tassist/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2425S2-CS2103-F15-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2425S2-CS2103-F15-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/tassist/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<puml src="diagrams/LogicClassDiagram.puml" width="550"/>

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("del -i 1,3,5")` API call as an example.

<puml src="diagrams/DeleteMultipleIndexesSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `del -i 1,3,5` Command" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline continues till the end of diagram.
</box>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it is passed to an `AddressBookParser` object which in turn creates a parser that matches the command (e.g., `DeleteCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `DeleteCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to delete a student).<br>
   Note that although this is shown as a single step in the diagram above (for simplicity), in the code it can take several interactions (between the command object and the `Model`) to achieve.
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<puml src="diagrams/ParserClasses.puml" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2425S2-CS2103-F15-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/tassist/model/Model.java)

<puml src="diagrams/ModelClassDiagram.puml"/>


The `Model` component,

* stores TAssist data i.e., all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `AddressBook`, which `Person` references. This allows `AddressBook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` objects.<br>

<puml src="diagrams/BetterModelClassDiagram.puml"/>

</box>

### LoadDataCommand

The `LoadDataCommand` allows TAssist to import student data from external files in `.csv` or `.json` format.

- It is parsed by `LoadDataCommandParser`, which validates the file name and extension.
- Supported extensions: `.csv` and `.json`.
- Upon execution, the command passes control to the `Storage` component, which attempts to read the file and parse its contents.
- The parsed students are added into the existing TAssist model. Duplicate and malformed entries are filtered with user-facing error messages.
- If the data file is missing, corrupted, or contains entries violating the schema, the command raises a `CommandException` with detailed context.

<puml src="diagrams/LoadDataSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="Sequence diagram for LoadDataCommand" />

This feature streamlines bulk data import and is useful for onboarding existing records into TAssist with minimal manual effort.

### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2425S2-CS2103-F15-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/tassist/storage/Storage.java)

<puml src="diagrams/StorageClassDiagram.puml" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both taassist data and user preference data in JSON and CSV format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.tassist.commons` package.

## **Appendix: Requirements**

### Product scope

**Target user profile**:

* CS2106 Teaching Assistants (TAs)
* Manage multiple tutorial groups per semester
* Need access to student information to track participation, assignments, and communicate with students
* May want to identify and support weaker students who require extra attention
* Has a need to manage a significant number of contacts
* Prefer desktop apps over other types
* Can type fast
* Prefers typing instead of mouse interactions
* Is reasonably comfortable using CLI apps

**Value proposition**: CS2106 TAs struggle to efficiently track progress and access student information with multiple tutorial groups and many students in each. The lack of a centralized system makes management and follow-ups tedious. TAssist provides a keyboard-driven platform that streamlines student organization into meaningful groups, enabling access to key details anytime, anywhere.

## **Appendix: Planned Enhancements**

### UI glitch upon selecting contact

A bug causes the selection of a contact to slightly flicker. This is likely due to the loading of attendance tags.

### Ensuring readable non-alphanumerical characters.

This pertains to the `NAME`, `FACULTY`, and `REMARK` of a contact.
To allow for overzealous input validation, the application allows for most unicode characters to be provided. As such, one can have names such as `恵凛`, `まさひろ`, or even `Nguyễn Thị Minh Hằng`. However, due to the extensive nature of such characters, we have not properly ensured that all characters can be displayed by the UI, and may appear as `▯` instead. Considering the fact that this application is targeted for English typists, we strongly recommend only alphanumerical characters be provided to the application instead.

## **Appendix: Effort**

### Difficulty level

We rate the Team Project (TP) a 8/10.

### Challenges faced

- Navigating through the large code base proved to be a significant challenge, especially at the start. It was hard to understand what went wrong and debugging took a significant amount of time and effort.

- Creation of test cases was also difficult, especially when thinking of creative ways to break the code or handle unexpected input.

- Trying to establish a balance when restricting user inputs was also difficult. While flexibility allowed for overzealous inputs, it also creates more opportunities for different user combinations to potentially generate crashes which has to be separately tested.

- JavaFX was new to everyone in the team. As such, minor improvements to the UI came at the cost of extensive debugging and researching for solutions online to circumvent issues.

### Effort required

- A lot of effort was required by many to ensure that deadlines were met. Work schedules had to be rearranged to ensure that PR's from all members are vetted and accepted before submission deadlines.

### Achievements

- Despite the seemingly minute additions to the MVP in terms of features, our goals were achieved.

- A deeper understanding of software development and the tools available (e.g. Git).
